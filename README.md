# ❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

### 🎯 Internship Task - Prodigy Tech Info
This project is part of an internship assignment from **Prodigy Tech Info**. It is a browser-based **Tic-Tac-Toe game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, allowing users to play against another player or an AI opponent.


## 🕹️ Features
- ✅ **Two-Player Mode**: Play turn-by-turn with a friend.
- 🤖 **AI Mode (Optional)**: Play against a basic computer opponent.
- 🧠 **Game Logic**:
  - Handles user input
  - Tracks game state
  - Checks for win/draw conditions
- 🔄 **Restart Option**: Reset the game anytime and play again.
- 🎨 **Interactive UI**: Stylish and responsive board layout.
- 🧼 **Clean UX**: Visual feedback for player turns and game result.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Game layout and UI structure.
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Core logic for game functionality and user interaction.


## 🎮 How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in any browser.
2. Player 1 is assigned "X" and Player 2 or AI is assigned "O".
3. Players take turns clicking empty squares.
4. The first to get 3 marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins!
5. If all 9 cells are filled with no winner, it’s a draw.


## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
By completing this task, I gained experience with:
- Event handling using `addEventListener`
- DOM manipulation to update the game board
- Implementing core game logic and state management
- Creating responsive layouts using CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Optionally integrating basic AI decision-making
